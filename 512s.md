parts
----

* 2xSTM32F401 we act pins
* 60 signal diodes 1N4148 , do 35
* 2 encoders
* 3x4.7kΩ
* 4x220Ω - these are for leds so you may have to compute the R to match your colours and desired brightness.
* 4 leds
* 2 40 pin DIL/DIP sockets whatever you prefer
* 2 JST XH 2.54 3P angle connectors, optionally another too for led strip
* cable to work with the sockets, direct not crossed wires
* led strip 3pins
* 5 pin MX switches 60
* lego 16x16 plates for bottom, and bricks as you please
