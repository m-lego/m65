5x12 split in lego
==================


the pcb
-------


**note** I will release the project fully once things are tested. I am doing this out of hobby but the plan is to have a fully functional
product hence the delays. if you want to sponsor by ordering prototypes and sharing some of the boards and cost with me I am more
than happy. This will speedup the process and you will end up with some boards, if fully functional
