### introduction

this is a pos tipro 8x16 which I converted to use qmk.
It is a "handwired" like project with a daugher board.

Originals I got from ebay, some new in box, for 15 or so years, some in bad shape. the plate is some form of painted steel that I
had to polish to remove the old paint. switches were cherry black, 3pin, that I desoldered and replaced with whatever I had handy in
the right quantity. keycaps for this mt3 dasher... with dev/tty

it uses stm32f401 on a pcb but since there are not enough pins for the 7 leds I used a shift register to control the leds.
firmware is qmk...
The case on this one is painted since was excessive yellowed by time.

total price of conversion around Â£10.
